Thanks for using utopia client, the fastest free chatpacking client in the world!
Firstly you will need a few pip installs that i will list below:


pip install requests
pip install discord.py
pip install discord.py-self
pip install discord.py==1.7.3
pip install discord==2.3.2


When your finished doing those you should be able to run the utopiaclient.exe and get your token ready to paste in, it will look something like this:
https://fxlseownsyou.can-fuck.me/yo8CI
Once you paste your discord token in the bot should be connected as it will tell you.
When your finished you can use ,cmds to show the commands that you have access to and you can use.

When you're finished with that you can change the .txt documents to your liking, here are some examples:
AR.txt = auto response
Spam.txt = spam text
userids = your current discord user id
gcc.txt = what the groupchat name will be constantly changed to, for example it will say:
"your a cuck 1" "your a cuck 2" your a cuck 3" ect ect ect

If you have problems with the client not working for some reason try these simple solutions: 

pip uninstall discord.py
pip uninstall discord
pip uninstall discord.py==1.7.3
